# Learning Activities Template

[![templateimg]][templatepdf]

Our learning activity template is used to create a concise overview of a learning activity. By answering the WH-questions, activities can be distinguished and combined not only with regards to organizational matters. The WHY question is the link to the learning goals based on the cognitive process and knowledge dimensions. Thus, the template assists to balance the granularity of selected activities, define intermediate goals, or align content and methods of activities.

# Learning Activities Matrix

[![courseplanimg]][courseplanpdf]

This didactic structure chart for an InfoVis course based on the interface construction kit shows vis activities (blue) and included learning activities. This chart arranges learning activities chronologically along the cognitive process dimension. This chart reveals whether the complexity of the learn- ing activities grows moderately, e.g. whether sufficient basic skills are taught. The types of knowledge are included as an attribute of the learning activities.
