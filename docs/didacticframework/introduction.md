# Introduction

Our didactic vis framework is mainly based on Bloom’s learning taxonomy, which has been widely adopted to formulate learning goals according to the cognitive process and form of knowledge involved in an activity. For our activities, we use the revised taxonomy’s cognitive process dimension (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create) and knowledge dimension (Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, and Meta-Cognitive).
